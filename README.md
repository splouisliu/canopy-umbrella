# canopy-umbrella

An existing patio canopy umbrella has been redesigned and improved for accessibilitiy as it tends to be difficult to use by the elderly. The primary objectives were to relocate the operating crank to a lower position, reduce operating force required, and reduce operating time, all while maintaining the original functionalities of the umbrella.

These MATLAB simulations model the deployment and adjustment mechanisms of two umbrella designs. They are used to make performance comparisons and optimize physical design parameters. It incorporates vector loop analysis, which allows measurements to be taken at any point. Example measurements include:

  - Position, velocity, acceleration at a particular point
  - Deployment time
  - Tilt angles
  - Linkage lengths and ratios
  - etc.
